I'm Jesseba, a Network Science PhD student at Northeastern University. I'm advised by [Dr. Sam Scarpino](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/people/samuel-v-scarpino). I'm broadly interested in learning and adaptation in both biological and artificial systems and how one can inform the other.

My research focuses on understanding how networks reorganize during learning and adaptation, bridging neuroscience and artificial intelligence through the lens of network science and information theory. I'm particularly interested in how information sharing patterns and network motifs evolve during learning and what governs this reorganization process.

Before joining Northeastern, I explored problems in systems neuroscience, studying how motivational states influence attention to sensory cues in the [Andermann Lab](https://www.andermannlab.com/). I investigated domain adaptation of medical imaging models with [William Lotter](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/people/william-lotter) at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. This interdisciplinary background, combining neuroscience, machine learning, and network science, has shaped my current approach to understanding complex adaptive systems.
