I was awarded the [AccelNet-MultiNet Fellowship](https://www.accelnet-multinet.org/) Award this year. I'll be collaborating with [Giovanni Petri](https://lordgrilo.github.io/), [Andrea Brovelli](https://brovelli.github.io/) and [Alain Barrat](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/english.html) on modeling neural dynamics this summer in Marseille and London!
